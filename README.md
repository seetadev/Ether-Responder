# Ether-Responder

Incident response and planner tools for road incident management and reducing traffic congestion, better control. Crowdsourcing traffic information sharing for better and safer roads.

Our solution offers an Artificial Intelligence-based object detection system that utilizes ethereum blockchain solutions using polygon for sorting information obtained from a variety of cameras. With just a cell phone, users are offered a serverless solution that can detect objects in real time and more object types for better accuracy.

Our technical solution enables driver monitoring, incident management and collision avoidance: Incident-based reporting & Collision detection (even when a vehicle is parked) and video footage associated with it. Video footage for abnormal driver behaviour (complete view of the car with 2 cameras â€“ front and back and open source video streaming), real-time alert and live streaming using open source AWS solutions.

Any abnormal behaviour/activity can be displayed on the smart dashboard in the vehicle.

Built-in GPS technology useful in fleet management and tracking. Black box car tracking to be able to pre-empt and diagnose breakdowns more quickly. Recognition area built in the central control to pick up your body movements, GAIT analysis Vehicles become IoT devices which can connect to smartphones, take voice commands, change the user interface.

The decentralized Cloud-Connected Car Drives IoT Monetization. Real-time access to car availability and mobile connectivity enables better decisions making systems.

We have developed a road incident management system using Javascript, HTML5, SAP's UI5 on the front end using open source AWS video streaming system and crowdsourcing marketplace enabled by Sequence Wallet and Spheron for enabling sharing of government assets like toll prepaid card, car details information for interstate travel, driving license management and quarterly pollution check and control powered by Ethercalc (SocialCalc), Polygon, NFTPorts for infrastructure and access of data from Polygon blockchains, NFT.Storage, Lit protocol for security and neume for data retrieval and at the road incident spot for better coordination and immediate action.




How it works:

Camera Management: Add/edit/delete cameras with a front end application with NFTPorts integration, NFT.Storage (IPFS/Filecoin) for snapshots of road incident, Sequence wallet for toll ticketing, neume for data retrieval.

Object Detection using open source AWS solutions and Pytorch/Tensorflow deep learning library using CNN neural networks.

Video analytics configuration using NFT.Storage, Litprotocol for security and neume for data retrieval.

Live streaming with Object Detection Video Analytics using open source AWS for streaming, Litprotocol for security and NFT.Storage for snapshots.

Alarm storage using Ethereum. Save/delete alarm metadata and image to/from IPFS using NFT.Storage. Store the hash returned from IPFS to Ethereum test network using NFT.Storage, Litprotocol for security and neume for data retrieval.. Provide links to alarms and blockchain transaction details.

Alarm Viewer: Add alarms with a single touch. Open the Alarm Settings menu from the home page. Add an alarm, set the wallpaper or choose an alarm tone. You can also delete an existing alarm. We are using Sequence wallet for NFT marketplace of alarm clock wallpapers and background ringtones purchase and auction. We are also extending and adapting Turtle Music using NFT Experiments for music curators for alarm clock. We are using DAOtooling for coordination with a social focus around community collaboration for road incidents and alarms.


NFT.Storage: We are using NFT.Storage for storing a variety of offchain data like incident snapshots, alarm metadata and object types at the time of incident. Please find the video at https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1bbHDoY1Y80EOeJP32XDngShnSjkMR55m (screencapturewithoutsound.mov file). We are storing Alarm metadata using NFT.Storage. Also, Saving/deleting alarm metadata and image to/from IPFS using NFT.Storage. We are also storing the hash returned from IPFS to Ethereum test network using NFT.Storage. Further we are using NFT.Storage for: Video analytics configuration using NFT.Storage; Camera Management: Add/edit/delete cameras with integration with Livepeer, NFT.Storage; Live streaming with Object Detection Video Analytics using Livepeer for streaming, and NFT.Storage for snapshots.

We are utilizing ZoraModuleManager, and ZoraProtocolFeeSettings in our our dapp and deploying it on Polygon after registering the Zora market module. We are developing a crowdsourcing marketplace using Zora's auction house template for enabling sharing of government assets like toll prepaid card, car details information for interstate travel, driving license management and quarterly pollution check and control. We are using the zora starter kit to access ZORA API, Creator Toolkit, and Marketplace Hyperstructure. Zora's Auction House template is being utilized for NFT marketplace of alarm clock wallpapers and background ringtones purchase and auction. We are also extending and adapting Turtle Music using NFT Experiments for music curators for alarm clock. We are using DAOtooling for coordination with a social focus around community collaboration for road incidents and alarms.

We are also using it for decentralized social sharing and road counselling at incident spot (please visit roadcounselingatincidents.mov)

Spheron: We are developing decentralized monitoring and incident management user interface with Spheron.

Sequence Wallet: We are utilizing Sequence wallet for handling renting payments for drones and maintenance/service payments on top of expenses claimed for getting the requisite flying licenses. It is our go to wallet for handling regional payments and third party payments like payments to government license regulators, repair providers. Please visit: https://github.com/seetadev/Ether-Responder/tree/main/SequenceQuickSwaptollticketmaster We also plan to integrate QuickSwap with Sequence wallet to ensure that the drone pilots can swap the tokens if needed at the time of service/repair or even getting flying license from regulators.
