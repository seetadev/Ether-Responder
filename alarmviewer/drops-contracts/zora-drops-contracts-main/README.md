We are utilizing ZoraModuleManager, and ZoraProtocolFeeSettings in our our dapp and deploying it on Polygon after registering the Zora market module. We are developing a crowdsourcing marketplace using Zora's auction house template for enabling sharing of government assets like toll prepaid card, car details information for interstate travel, driving license management and quarterly pollution check and control. We are using the zora starter kit to access ZORA API, Creator Toolkit, and Marketplace Hyperstructure. Zora's Auction House template is being utilized for NFT marketplace of alarm clock wallpapers and background ringtones purchase and auction. We are also extending and adapting Turtle Music using NFT Experiments for music curators for alarm clock. We are using DAOtooling for coordination with a social focus around community collaboration for road incidents and alarms.

We are also using it for decentralized social sharing and road counselling at incident spot (please visit roadcounselingatincidents.mov)


# Zora NFT Drop Media Contracts

### Integrating with Road Incident Management solution

1. Use wagmi/ethers/web3.js with the given artifacts (in the node package) or typechain.
2. Use our subgraph to find media / metadata information (rinkeby: https://thegraph.com/hosted-service/subgraph/iainnash/erc721droprinkeby) (mainnet: https://thegraph.com/hosted-service/subgraph/iainnash/zora-editions-mainnet)
3. For your edition, call `address(edition).purchase(quantity, {value: price * quantity})`. Price and availability can be found from the subgraph or from the blockchain with the `saleInfo` call.
4. Find the transfer() or sale() event from the transaction receipt to get the ID that the user minted.
5. âœ¨

### Features these contracts support:

1. ETH NFT sales
2. Modular admin access and minting controls
3. ERC2981 on-chain royalties
4. Presale merkle trees
5. On-chain modular rendering architecture
6. ERC721A Gas savings / linear mint
7. Limit mints per address when purchasing
8. Allows for new features with opt-in gated user upgrades
9. Allows for time-based open mints
10. Includes a platform royalty fee mechanism
11. Can admin mint NFTs to addresses and airdrop to lists of addresses

### What are these contracts?
1. `ERC721Drop`
   Each drop is a unique contract.
   This allows for easy royalty collection, clear ownership of the collection, and your own contract ðŸŽ‰
2. `ZoraNFTCreatorV1`
   Gas-optimized factory contract allowing you to easily + for a low gas transaction create your own drop contract.
3. `DropMetadataRenderer`
   A flexible metadata renderer architecture that allows for centralised and IPFS metadata group roots to be rendered.
4. `EditionsMetadataRenderer`
   A partially on-chain renderer for editions that encodes name and description on-chain with media metadata off-chain.
5. `UpgradeGate`
   A registry allowing for upgrades to be allowed for child contracts by `zora.eth`.
   
### Flexibility and safety

All drops contracts are wholly owned by their creator and allow for extensibility with rendering and minting.
The root drops contract can be upgraded to allow for product upgrades with new contracts and Zora gates allowed upgrade paths
for deployed contracts to be upgraded by the users of the platform to opt into new features.

The metadata renderer abstraction allows these drops contracts to power a variety of on-chain powered projects and also.
